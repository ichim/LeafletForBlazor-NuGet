# Charts and styles

All available charts are svg components displayed on a ViewBox with default dimensions of 100,100 (width:100, height:100).
Depending on the type of chart, there may be various svg/html elements on the ViewBox. Each item in a chart component can be customized using css properties.

To customize a chart element, the Style library (provided by LeaflefForBlazer.css namespace) is used.
