# Nearby Points Tracking 
## About example
In this example, a simulator for moving points on the map is used. 4 distinct points will move on the map (each point represents something distinct - type property).
## Points map appearance
The points will be displayed with distinct symbols depending on the type property. There will be two distinct situations:
 - 1 the points are not close (distance > 30 m);
 - 2 the points are close (distance < 30 m);
### Points are not close
