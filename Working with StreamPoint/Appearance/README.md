Streampoint data defined based on a [Custom class](https://github.com/ichim/LeafletForBlazor-NuGet/tree/main/Working%20with%20StreamPoint#extending-streampoint-attributes) can be used to define the appearance in the map. To define the appearance of a point class in the StreamPoint collection, you must [use the Custom class](https://github.com/ichim/LeafletForBlazor-NuGet/tree/main/Working%20with%20StreamPoint/Appearance/Custom%20Attributes#appearance-based-on-custom-attributes) defined to extend the StreamPoint data structure.
