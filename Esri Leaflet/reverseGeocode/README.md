# Esri Reverse Geocode Task

It is an [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) task with which you can find the address of a location. In order to use this professional task, you must create a developer account on [ArcGIS.com](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html).

Reverse geocoding is the process of converting a location to an address or place. Esri Leaflet provides a geocoder to access the geocoding service.
